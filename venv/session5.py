function
 1. name
 2. inputs(may or may not) | parameters | arguments
 3. return (may or may not) | acknowledgement
 4. definition -> sequence
  why loop ?
        where we write statements which repeat again and again

        why functions?
           group of statemnts / logic which has to be executed again and again

           modularization is soemthing which we are doing in our program to simply the process
